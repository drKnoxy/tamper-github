# Tampering with Github

## Features
1. Collapsing headers in file diffs
  * There is an added button in the file diff button bar for collapsing all files
  * Or you can click the file header to collapse just the one file
1. Whitespace toggle in diffs
  * like the `-b` option in terminal, but for github! very exciting
